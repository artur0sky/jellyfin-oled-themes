## 📖 About

**Jellyfin OLED Themes** is a collection of high-quality, elegant themes designed specifically for OLED displays. The primary goal is to create a deeply immersive experience by utilizing **True Black** (`#000000`) backgrounds, which not only looks stunning but also helps **save battery life** on mobile OLED devices.

Inspired by the beautiful work of [ElegantFin](https://github.com/lscambo13/ElegantFin), this project takes a technical approach to styling, leveraging modern web standards and the vibrant color palette of **Tailwind CSS v4**.

## ✨ Features

- **🖤 OLED Optimization**: Uses pure black backgrounds to turn off pixels on OLED screens, providing infinite contrast and battery savings.
- **🎨 Tailwind v4 Colors**: Each theme variant is based on the official [Tailwind CSS v4 color palettes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors), utilizing modern `oklch()` color spaces for superior vibrancy.
- **🔤 Modern Typography**: Integrated **[Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik)** font for a clean, geometric, and legible interface.
- **🟢 Material Icons**: Replaces standard icons with **Material Symbols Rounded** for a polished, consistent look.
- **📱 Mobile First**: deeply optimized for touch devices and smaller screens without compromising the desktop experience.

## 🎨 Available Themes
